# Just! Build! Apps!

" The hosts of [Shop Talk show](http://shoptalkshow.com/) podcast (Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert) get asked a lot of questions about how to learn web development. Their mantra is "just build websites"; [there's even a soundbite for it](http://shoptalkshow.com/mantra/). Getting your hands dirty with some web projects and filling in the gaps in your knowledge along the way is a beautiful way of doing things." - @melanierichards
